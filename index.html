        <p>This resource for your course will help you review grammar structures or vocabulary by providing more examples, additional explanations, and exercises for you to solve. This resource is primarily based on the Academic Program, as well as the content of your coursebook and, of course, the class you are taking this semester. 
        Remember, there is no real substitute for your personal effort. Using new vocabulary is the only way to expand your thoughts.</p>
